# 3D-print by yourself

We have the JetBot's chassis STL file for 3d-printing in our repo.<br/>
You can use your 3D printer to print the chassis in whatever color you want.

## Facts about 3d-printing JetBot chassis

## Filaments we used

We mainly printed with PLA filaments.<br/>
We tested ABS and PETG on each printer, but nothing came out well.

### Filaments we had good results with

We printed below filaments (1.75mm) with [Monoprice Voxel](https://amzn.to/2GbUJ5Q) and had great results.

## Verdict

3D printer is getting pretty affordable and easy to get the same quality.
If you are to get more than 3 units, it's worth getting a 3d printer and spending a little time to master the tricks so that you can print whatever you want.
