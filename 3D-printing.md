## Print by yourself

If you have a 3D printer on hand, we recommend printing the JetBot components yourself!
The following parts must be printed for each JetBot chassis.

* [Chassis](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/chassis.stl)
* [Caster Base](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/caster_base.stl)
* [Caster Shroud](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/caster_base.stl)
* [Camera Mount](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/camera_mount.stl)

### Print details

Below are some facts related to printing a single JetBot

* Print time:  10-12 hours
* Material used:  < 100 grams
* Material cost:  ~ $2

### Printers

We've tested that the following printers are able to print the JetBot chassis.

| Model | Cost | URL |

### Filaments

Based on our experience, we recommend using PLA filament when printing JetBot.  Below is a collection
of filaments that we have printed the JetBot chassis with on the [Monoprice Voxel](https://amzn.to/2GbUJ5Q) 3D printer.

| Brand | Thickness | Material | Color | URL | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| AmazonBasics | 1.75mm | PLA | Silver | [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2BkrKZP) | Smooth, dark metallic finish |
