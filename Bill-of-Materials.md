## 3D Printed Components

The following parts must be 3D printed for each JetBot chassis.

* [Chassis](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/chassis.stl)
* [Caster Base](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/caster_base.stl)
* [Caster Shroud](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/caster_shroud.stl)
* [Camera Mount](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT-private/jetbot/blob/master/assets/camera_mount.stl)

If you have a 3D printer on hand, the material cost is very low.  Otherwise, you could use an external printing service.

We provide more helpful information in the [3D printing](3d-printing) page.
